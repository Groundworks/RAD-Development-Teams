Just as a code repository can have many branches,
RAD Development can have many applications.
The official de-facto application is called **main**,
much inspired from the main branch of a code repository.

## Main

We use three applications in our stack:

1. HipChat
2. Github
3. Trello

The goal is to avoid wasting time,
and keep people productive.

1. use [HipChat](../HipChat.md) for notifications and brain dumps
2. use [github](../Git.md) for the important stuff
3. keep [Trello](../Trello.md) focused on features
