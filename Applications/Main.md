# Main

The main way RAD teams are deployed is with 
the following application stack:

1. HipChat
2. Github
3. Trello

The goal is to avoid wasting time,
and keep people productive.

1. use [HipChat](../HipChat.md) for notifications and brain dumps
2. use [github](../Git.md) for the important stuff
3. keep [Trello](../Trello.md) focused on features
