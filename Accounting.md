# Estimation & Accounting

There is no developer estimation, there is no developer accounting.

## Developer Estimation is a Voodoo Science

Voodoo science has the remarkable effect of seeming absolutely legitimate to those who believe in it,
but fails miserably when held to outside scrutiny.
Those of us entrenched in the science will often be able to rationalize the success of our practices,
which combined with people's nature to regard word-of-mouth as highly reliable,
makes voodoo sciences spread with viral speed.

The largest problem with estimation is that estimates are often treated as promises;
they are not.
As implied in the previous paragraph some people are tempted to develop clever ways of
turning estimates into promises, but these methods are just illusions.
The truth of the matter is that every minute spent on estimation
is a minute spent not advancing your overall goal.

Estimates when turned into promises are often used as soft or hard deadlines for the development team.
If a development team is operating at maximum efficiency,
what about having a deadline is expected to improve your teams pace?
Important ideas should be prioritized but giving deadlines to development teams only serves to
slow the team down and delay the final product.

In practice deadlines are often given as a way of passing blame.
Stakeholders who fail their obligations can use a missed deadline 
to pass the blame onto the development team.
This is not going to benefit anyone least of all the company.

Eliminate developer estimates.

### Stakeholder Estimates

Eliminating developer estimates is about increasing developer efficiency and moving the duty of
time management to the stakeholders, not about freeing developers to be lazy or laissez-faire.

Stakeholders need to estimate because _they_ need to do accounting, planning, and budgeting.
RAD does provide help here; we do not advocate a total abandonment of planning,
but we provide a filter to keep estimation realistic and necessary.

Stakeholders can estimate duration of projects up to the accuracy they 
can estimate the set of features required by the project.
Every feature has a duration of 4 days, and teams will have a visible **pace**
i.e. the number of features completed per week or month.

Estimation can be done *without* developers making promises.

## No Accounting

Developers do not estimate, and developers do not do accounting.
There is no explicit breakdown of hours per feature, or hours worked per week.
Accounting is another activity that gets in the way of the real goal, working software.

Stakeholders can do accounting at the feature level, no smaller.
