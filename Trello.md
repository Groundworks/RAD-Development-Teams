# Using RAD Dev with Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a project tracking website.
For RAD Development Teams,
Trello serves as the Kanban board that will display the at-a-glance
status of features as they are implemented.
The board should _not_ include implementation details relevant only to developers.

Generally create columns on the board _only_ when features need to be passed between groups,
such as the product owner and developers.

## The Feature Queue

Trello uses a feature queue, not a *todo list*.
This is important to understand,
as people fresh from project management arenas will be
tempted to slot tasks into the **backlog**.

The only things that belong in the backlog are **product features**.

### Product Feature

1. A product feature is the description of a real, 
   tangible result that creates new value in the product.
2. Product features should describe the product from the user perspective.
3. Features should be small units of increment, doable in 3-4 days.

Writing good features is a skill that takes time.
Features should be clear and well-defined,
but not too obsessive about implementation details..

## Roles

There are two main roles, the **Product Owner** (or Product Associate),
and a **Developer**,
however there is only one team.
The PO is part of the development team,
but they do not do any actual coding.

Each role affects the feature queue differently.
The PO adds and prioritizes features in the backlog,
and verifies completed work in the **done** column.

Developers move features through the pipeline by pulling the top most item from backlog,
implementing it and moving them into done.
Features should have an average pace between 3-4 days between start and completion.
